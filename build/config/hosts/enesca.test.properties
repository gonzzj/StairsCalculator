# RSync exclude patterns
sync.exclude.file=build/config/project.enesca.exclude

# Remote hostname details (the password is not saved)
sync.remote.host=polarbeardevelopment.com
sync.remote.user=polarbeardev

# If your remote host doesn't host an SSH keyfile leave empty
sync.identityfile=/home/.ssh/id_rsa

# The parent directory of your DocumentRoot
sync.destination.projectdir=/home/polarbeardev/public_html/enesca
